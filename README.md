# Unveiling the Hidden Burden of COVID-19 in Brazil's obstetric population with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: a machine learning model

This cross-sectional study analyzed retrospective data of pregnant and postpartum women diagnosed with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) between January 2016 and November 2021. Patients were divided into two groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) for comparative analysis, and a XGBoost predictive model was constructed to classify cases without a defined causative agent. The results suggest that the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the obstetric population was much higher than documented by authorities, indicating a significant impact on the maternal mortality ratio during this period.
